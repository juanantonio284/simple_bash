## awk

(Aho, Weinberger, Kernighan)

`awk` is a pattern scanning and processing language/utility **used to extract and then print
specific contents of a file** and is often used to construct reports `awk` was created at Bell Labs
in the 1970s and derived its name from the last names of its authors: 
**Aho**, **Weinberger**, **Kernighan**.

* `awk` is used to manipulate data files, retrieving, and processing text
* `awk` works well with fields (containing a single piece of data, essentially a column) and records
  (a collection of fields, essentially a line in a file)
* An input file is read one line at a time, and, for each line, `awk` matches the given pattern in
  the given order and performs the requested action.
